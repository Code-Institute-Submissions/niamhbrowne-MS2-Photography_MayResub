# Milestone Project-2
## Website for Wedding Photographer
<p>For my second milestone project I have chosen to create a website for a wedding Photographer. The website has a navigation bar at the top of each page allowing the user to navigate their way through the page.  There are three main pages which are linked in the navigation bar; Jude Browne Wedding Stories (home page), Blog and Contact page. The blog and contact page have buttons and links directing users to new pages.</p>

## UX
<!------------------------Add in Text-->

### <em>User Stories</em>
<ul>
<li>As a visiting user, I want to see social media links on a website so I can view images and posts that the photographer uploads on them.</li>
<li>As a visiting user, I want to see reviews when Iâ€™m on a photography website without having to search for them myself.</li>
<li>As a visiting user, I want to send off queries to the photographer to answer my questions whilst using the website.</li>
<li>As a visiting user, I want to see where each picture was taken as google maps so I can choose the best spots.</li>
<li>As a visiting user, I want to see a variety of images that the photographer has taken.</li>
</ul>

## <em>Design Process</em>

<p>I have designed wireframes to help me plan my project and follow an idea of what I want the finished project to look like and function.</p>
