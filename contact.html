<p>“I can’t recommend Jude Browne enough as a wedding photographer. She was so easy to deal with and is a genuine nice person. She made us feel relaxed and helped the day run smoothly. 
Our photos are amazing and we couldn’t have imagined them to turn out as well as they did. You can tell by the photos that she didn’t take her eyes off us both all day, capturing such lovely looks at one another and great photos of our friends and family too.”</p>

<p>“We are so grateful that as part of our date change in 2020, it meant we booked you for our big day. From the start you were so easy to work with & when I contacted you to say I was thinking of bringing my wedding forward, nothing was a problem & you came up with the brilliant suggestion of coming back for my Day 2 with my friends so I got pics with them AND got to wear my wedding dress for 2 full days! We absolutely love love love all of our pics, they capture our chilled out, fun day & all the emotions of both us & our guests in the most natural way I have ever seen from a photographer. We cannot thank you enough & we will continue to recommend you to everyone we know who is planning their weddings over the next few years. Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts.”</p>

<p>“Jude was our photographer 7.11.2020. We lost and regained her with moving dates and venues and by God am so grateful that we regained her.  Firstly Jude is such a lovely person to deal with - calm, efficient and relaxed. She made us feel at ease all day.  Her style of photography is effortless yet there is so much attention to detail. She is extremely creative, gives good guidance and researches where to get the best shots. We will cherish our pictures for life and are so grateful that Jude was such a big part of our day. We cannot thank you enough.”</p>
